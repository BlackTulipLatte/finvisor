These new agreements will help more than 90 per cent of credit card-accepting businesses in Canada qualify for lower rates and see their interchange fees reduced by up to 27 per cent from the existing weighted average rate.

Specifically, small businesses with annual Visa sales volume below $300,000 will qualify for the lower interchange fees from Visa, and those with annual Mastercard sales volume below $175,000 will qualify for the lower fees from Mastercard. Non-profit organizations with transaction volumes below these thresholds will also benefit from reduced rates.\nAs specified in Budget 2023, the government\u2019s expectation is that commitments by credit card networks to lower interchange fees for small businesses will not adversely impact interchange fees paid by other businesses. The government also expects other credit card companies to take similar actions to lower fees for small businesses, and that payment processors will pass these reductions on to small businesses.\nAs part of these new agreements with Visa and Mastercard, Canada\u2019s large banks have agreed to protect Canadians\u2019 reward points.\nThe new rates will come into effect in the fall of 2024 to allow time to complete the required system updates.

Canada\u2019s economic growth was the strongest in the G7 over the last year, and today, 865,000 more Canadians are employed than before the pandemic, including 136,900 in Quebec. Inflation in Canada has fallen for eight months in a row, our unemployment rate is near its record low, and, supported by our Canada-wide system of affordable early learning and child care, the labour force participation rate for women aged 25 to 54 reached a record high of 85.7 per cent in February.\nHowever, inflation is still making it difficult for many Canadians to make ends meet and put food on the table. Groceries are more expensive today, and for many people, higher prices on other essential goods are causing undue stress. That\u2019s why Budget 2023 provides new, targeted inflation relief for the most vulnerable Canadians to help support them with the cost of living.\nBudget 2023 delivers the new Grocery Rebate, which would offer targeted inflation relief for 11 million Canadians and families who need it most with up to an additional $467 for eligible couples with two children; an additional $234 for single Canadians without children; and an additional $225 for seniors, on average.\nTo make life more affordable, the government is also taking action to crack down on junk fees and predatory lending, lower credit card transaction fees for small businesses, and help Canadians keep more money in their pockets.",

No matter how much money people make, where they were born or what their parents do, they can receive the care they need. However, our public health care system is not delivering the high-quality care that Canadians deserve. For example, surgeries have been postponed or cancelled. Our public health care system, and the workers who uphold it, are under enormous strain. This situation was made worse by the pandemic and requires immediate action.\nTo strengthen Canada\u2019s universal public health care system, the budget delivers $198.3 billion over ten years, including $3.8 billion in New Brunswick, to reduce backlogs, expand access to family health services, and ensure provinces and territories can provide the high-quality and timely health care Canadians expect and deserve.\nBudget 2023 also introduces a new Canadian Dental Care Plan that will begin to roll out by the end of this year and be fully implemented by 2025. This will provide dental coverage to up to nine million Canadians and will ensure no one has to choose between taking care of their health and paying the bills at the end of the month.\nWith these significant investments\u2014as well as new measures to address the shortage of health care professionals in rural and remote communities, safeguard access to abortion and other sexual and reproductive health care services, combat the opioid crisis, and ensure that Canadians can receive critical mental health support\u2014Budget 2023 will help build a healthier Canada from coast to coast to coast.",

The federal government is committed to advancing the Atlantic Loop\u2014a series of interprovincial transmission lines that will provide clean electricity between New Brunswick, Quebec, and Nova Scotia. The Government of Canada is currently negotiating with New Brunswick, other provinces, and utilities to identify a clear path to deliver the project by 2030.\nWith Budget 2023, investments into Canada\u2019s clean economy will deliver good paying careers, support vibrant communities, and create economic prosperity today and for the next generation.

Canada\u2019s net debt-to-GDP ratios are well below the average for the OECD, the European Union, and the United States. This continued track record of fiscal strength has allowed the government to continue providing necessary, targeted economic support to help those who need it most.\nThe OECD\u2019s updated economic forecasts positively reflect the resilience of the Canadian economy during a period of global economic uncertainty by projecting an improvement in GDP growth compared to its November forecasts, with growth expected to be 1.3 per cent in 2023 and 1.5 per cent in 2024. The OECD also projects that inflation will return to its target of 2 per cent by the end of 2024.\nThe OECD also commends Canada\u2019s ambitious actions on climate change and recognizes the central role carbon pollution pricing has in Canada\u2019s national climate plan as a way to \u201creduce emissions at a lower cost than other policies\u201d. The report also emphasizes how \u201cpublic investment, including in green energy projects, can spur activity and job creation in hard-hit regions\u201d, and that the proposed federal carbon capture, utilization, and storage investment tax credit is \u201cappropriately designed\u201d.\nThe OECD \u201cwelcomes\u201d recent investments in health care, including the Canada Dental Benefit, and highlighted Canada\u2019s commitment to moving forward on plans to address key social-economic challenges. In particular, the OECD underscores the importance of the Canada-wide affordable early learning and child care system, which is already helping to reduce gender gaps and make life more affordable for Canadian families.\nFinally, the OECD calls on Canada to continue improving productivity and investment growth, which \u201chas weakened relative to the United States and other leading OECD economies\u201d, and to continue its focus on reducing barriers to internal trade and on harmonizing rules governing trade and labour mobility between provinces and territories to improve competitiveness. The federal government agrees.",

The CIC will operate with an initial budget of $2.6 billion over four years, and is expected to begin its operations in 2023.\nCanadian research facilities are home to some of the most talented people in their fields in the world. With robust start-up ecosystems across the country and countless firms in commodity-based and traditional sectors that could be transformed into technology-driven global leaders, Canada has all of the fundamentals required to build a stronger and more innovative economy.  \nHowever, Canadian businesses do not invest in R&D to the same degree as their global peers, which weakens Canada\u2019s economic competitiveness and reduces opportunities for Canadian workers. Canadian businesses\u2014including those operating in established commodity-based and manufacturing industries\u2014need enhanced support to make R&D investments that will generate new and improved globally competitive products, processes, and services.\nThe CIC will help Canadian businesses across all sectors and regions to innovate, commercialize, grow, and create good jobs in a changing global economy. Using best practices established by similar agencies around the world, the CIC will be an operationally independent, outcome-driven organization, that will work with the private sector to provide targeted support to new and established Canadian firms by delivering funding and advisory services.\nThe blueprint document released today provides details on how the CIC will operate, with further details on the standing up of the CIC\u2019s operations to be announced in the coming months.",
